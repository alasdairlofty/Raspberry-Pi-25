Our project for the “Healthier Humans” section of the Raspberry Pi Competition focuses on improving player safety in contact sports through a smart impact-detecting scrum cap. Using a Raspberry Pi as our base, and an IMU, MCU and RF Transmitter within the cap, the system continuously monitors the force and frequency of impacts to the player’s head. When an impact exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating a potential risk of concussion or head injury, the cap immediately sends a real-time notification to a coach or parent via the connected app. This instant alert allows for rapid assessment and intervention, helping to prevent players from continuing to play after a dangerous impact. The project aims to raise awareness of sports-related head injuries and promote safer sporting environments for young athletes.
